## Conway's Game of Life
Made following along [this project](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/), a quick exercise with python. For my own records, nothing life changing. 

### Project Outline:
---- 
- `main.py`
	- Most of the code, all the stuff you'd expect
- `display.py`
	- Display stuff, rendering the board and sleeping between frames. 
- `tests/next_board_test.py`
	- Features the provided unit tests from the project write up. Used to debug and work towards completion on the final stages of the main loop.
